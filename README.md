## Welcome to my GitHub repository! :) 

This repository serves as a collection of useful functions and codes that I've developed for academic purposes.  

In this space, you'll find:

- **Functions:** Efficient and reusable codes which I used in my articles and/or academic applications.
- **Tools:** Scripts and utilities that have supported my research and projects.
- **Examples:** Codes with applications and examples to demonstrate the use of my programmes.

Feel free to explore and use my codes as you see fit.
